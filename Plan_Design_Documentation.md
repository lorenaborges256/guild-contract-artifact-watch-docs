## 6. ERD explanation

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) models the core data structures and interactions within the Guild Contract & Artifact Watch System, capturing how users engage with artifacts, quests, reservations, and notifications. It separates the two availability, behaviours—inventory‑based items and time‑window‑based quests—into distinct entities, each with their own attributes and relational rules. Supporting entities such as Reservation, QuestAcceptance, Watchlist, and Notification represent user actions and system‑generated events, ensuring that every interaction is stored in a structured and traceable way.

 The ERD follows a fully normalised design, reducing redundancy and clarifying the relationships between users, items, and quests, while also supporting polymorphic associations for watch and notification functionality. This schema provides a stable foundation for the application’s API, business logic, and future scalability.
